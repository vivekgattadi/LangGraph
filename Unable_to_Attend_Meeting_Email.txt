Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to let you know that I am unable to attend the meeting we scheduled for 10 AM. However, I am available to meet at 12:00 PM the next day in New York. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and hope we can reschedule to this new time.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Vivek
